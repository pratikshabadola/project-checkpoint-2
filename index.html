        <p>Hi nice to meet you! My name is Pratiksha Badola and I am, among other things, a passionate reader. I love sharing my thoughts on books with others and engaging with others about my favourite books, and this blog is a manifestation of that! Here I review my recent reads, update my TBR list and host my book club! If any of that interests you, read on!</p>

        <p>A little about my readiing journey...</p>
        <p>When I was in the 5th grade, my teacher read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to the class. I had no idea books could be so transporting, vivid, and fun. I was hooked. Not long after that the Twilight phenomenon took off. The double impact of the Harry Potter and Twilight series so early on in my life made me an avid reader. So although those series may seen juvenile, they were really a gateway to a world of words, and I haven't looked back since. 
			Though as I progressed through school and life, reading often took a back burner as school became more demanding. To combat this, I have been making it a conscious effort to stay consistent with reading, and one way I do this is by establishing yearly reading goals. For 2022, I am aiming to read 30 books.
